# hullabaloo-core design

`hullabaloo-core` provides shared low-level structures and algorithms used by solver-facing crates:

- compact row/column set types (`types`)
- set-family storage/builders (`set_family`)
- dense matrix helpers (`matrix`)
- adjacency graph construction (`adjacency`, `adjacency_list`)
